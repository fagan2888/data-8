wind plan:

re-screen for slopes, exclude golf courses and roads

re-run turbine siting with looser spacing, per e-mails with HECO in July 2016 (5-8 MW per km^2)

use nrel system advisor model to convert wind speeds (from OWITS with AWS sub-cell scaling factors) to power production (instead of our own power curve and derates from HECO 2013 IRP); hopefully this includes accurate conversion factors and losses

aggregate based on quality and region?
