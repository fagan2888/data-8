Hawaii RTMA data are available via THREDDS, HAS, HTTP/FTP at https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/model-data/model-datasets/national-digital-guidance-database-ndgd

Also see https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/model-data/model-datasets/national-digital-forecast-database-ndfd; their WMO Heading Reference indicates YCS... would be Hawaii wind speeds.

The HAS link (http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/has/HAS.FileAppRouter?datasetname=9950_01&subqueryby=STATION&applname=&outdest=FILE) from that page gets you to an interactive file selector, which identifies the following useful file prefixes for HI RTMA data: LNH=wind speed and direction, LPH=surface pressure, LTH=surface temperature, LHH=terrain height

This is probably 10-m wind height, based on https://ams.confex.com/ams/pdfpapers/124825.pdf

The TDS link (http://nomads.ncdc.noaa.gov/thredds/catalog/ndgd/catalog.html) shows the available files and can be used with opendap.

I installed pydap in the anaconda installation, which may be suitable for downloading these data.

Hawaii RTMA uses AWIPS Grid 196 (see http://www.nco.ncep.noaa.gov/pmb/products/rtma/). 

Grid 196 documented here: http://www.nco.ncep.noaa.gov/pmb/docs/on388/tableb.html#GRID196
The documentation is documented here (sort of): http://www.nco.ncep.noaa.gov/pmb/docs/on388/
See especially the "Mercator Grids" section of http://www.nco.ncep.noaa.gov/pmb/docs/on388/tabled.html

TODO: 
(improve below: first download wind speed data for complete grid, hour by hour, and write incrementally into many srw files, one for each cell; then do the calculations for allowed cells; srw format is documented here: https://www.nrel.gov/analysis/sam/help/html-php/index.html?weather_format.htm
https://www.nrel.gov/analysis/sam/help/html-php/weather_format.htm#srw; maybe omit data for leap day per https://sam.nrel.gov/content/questions-regarding-pvwattsfunc-ssc (although PVWatts seems to just skip over leap days))
note: I may need to save data as if it were measured closer to hub height, because SAM will only scale within 35 meters
create corresponding grid in QGIS
identify allowed areas in each cell
calculate average latitude and longitude of allowed areas in each cell
calculate distance from allowed areas in each cell to interconnect (could be done in python)
create empty wind speed array (allowed cells x hours)
loop through years, months, days, hours:
    retrieve complete grid of wind speed data (or just allowed cells?)
    assign speeds to allowed cells
store all wind speed data and/or data for allowed cells
use SAM to calculate hourly power production in allowed area in each cell
use k-means clustering (with extra weight on interconnect distance) to cluster cells into ~20 tranches
save hourly profiles for each tranche (similar to rooftop solar)


Here's some sample code with pydap:

from pydap.client import open_url
dataset = open_url('http://nomads.ncdc.noaa.gov/thredds/dodsC/ndgd/201406/20140628/LNHA98_KWBR_201406281000')
print dataset.keys()
data = dataset['Wind_speed'][0, 0, :, :]  # downloads the data for one grid for this time step
print data['Wind_speed'].shape
data['Wind_speed'][0, 0, :3, :3]   # shows the data for the first 3x3 cells

# heat map of wind speeds
%matplotlib inline
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.imshow(data['Wind_speed'][0, 0], cmap='cool', interpolation='nearest')
